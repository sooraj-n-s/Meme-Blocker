## Basic Details
### Team Name: SOORAJ N S

### Team Members

### Project Description
A Chrome extension that blocks “productive” websites and forces you to watch a random meme video (Suresh Gopi, Mammootty, etc.) with sound. You can’t escape until the countdown ends.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People waste too much time being productive — emails, coding, studying… boring!  

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We save you from productivity by replacing your productive sites with legendary meme videos. A countdown ensures you enjoy the distraction fully.
