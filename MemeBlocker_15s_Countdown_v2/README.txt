Meme Blocker â€” 15s Countdown

1. Put your 3 MP4 files into the assets folder named:
   - suresh1.mp4
   - suresh2.mp4
   - mammootty.mp4

2. Open Chrome -> chrome://extensions -> Enable Developer Mode -> Load unpacked -> select this folder.

3. Click the extension icon -> add productive sites to block (e.g., docs.google.com).

4. Visit a blocked site -> the extension redirects to a random video and forces a 15s countdown before you can return.
