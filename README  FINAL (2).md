## Basic Details
### Team Name: The Procrastinators

### Team Members
- Team Lead: Sooraj N S - [MAR ATHANASIUS COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING]

### Project Description
A Chrome extension that blocks ‚Äúproductive‚Äù websites and forces you to watch a random meme video (Suresh Gopi, Mammootty, etc.) with sound. You can‚Äôt escape until the countdown ends.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People waste too much time being productive ‚Äî emails, coding, studying‚Ä¶ boring!  

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We save you from productivity by replacing your productive sites with legendary meme videos. A countdown ensures you enjoy the distraction fully.
